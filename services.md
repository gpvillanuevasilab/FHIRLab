Welcome. Glad we can be of service. Before you begin, please take in and heed the warning below. It is important and a condition of entry to FHIRLab's services.


<div class="callout callout--danger">
<strong>Warning: Do Not Store Real Patient Information</strong>

<p>This FHIR Sandbox is for testing and development purposes only. Do not store any real patient information on Sandbox servers. Storing real patient data on a public or unsecured server poses significant privacy and security risks.</p>

<strong>Only use synthetic or anonymized data for all activities.</strong>

</div>

Otherwise, you may want to look at our [Core Components](#core-components), the surrounding [Peripherals]() and how to [keep up-to-date]() with what is happening.

# Core Components

The core components form the basic FHIR learning sandbox which includes the components below. Click to have a look.

| Role                     | Project       | Entry Point      |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| [Clinical Data Repository](#clinical-data-repository) | [HAPI](service/HAPI)          | [http://cdr.fhirlab.net](http://cdr.fhirlab.net)       |
| [Terminology Server](#terminology-server)       | [Ontoserver](Ontoserver)    | [http://tx.fhirlab.net](http://tx.fhirlab.net)        |
| [Validator](#validator)                | [HL7 Validator](Validator) | [http://validator.fhirlab.net](http://validator.fhirlab.net) |
| [Testing Tool](#testing-tool)             | [Inferno](Inferno)       | [http://inferno.fhirlab.net](http://inferno.fhirlab.net)   |

These components provide a foundation for learning and experimenting with FHIR, enabling you to create and test FHIR-based applications. They form a set of essential open source FHIR components that together form a reference for a learner and are fairly easily replicated for local experimentation.

Please find details on our selected components and their roles below:

## Clinical Data Repository

   FHIRLab's CDR is the [HAPI Server](service/HAPI).
   
   * A centralized repository of standardized health data. 
   * Stores patient records, lab results, medications, and other relevant clinical information.
   * Enables data-driven insights and supports clinical decision-making.

## Terminology Server

   FHIRLab's Terminology Server is the [Ontoserver](Ontoserver).

   * Provides a central source of standardized healthcare terminology.
   * Includes code systems, value sets, and concept maps.
   * Ensures consistent data representation and interoperability.   

## Validator

   FHIRLab's Validator is the [HL7 Validator](Validator).

   * Verifies the accuracy and completeness of FHIR resources.
   * Checks compliance with FHIR standards and local implementation guidelines.
   * Helps developers identify and correct errors in their FHIR implementations.   

## Testing Tool

   FHIRLab's Testing Tool is [Inferno](Inferno).

   * Offers a range of tools for testing FHIR-based applications.
   * Includes test data generators, performance testing tools, and security testing tools.
   * Facilitates the development of robust and secure FHIR solutions.

# Peripheral Components

The Peripheral Components, also known as the **Galaxy** are a dynamic learning environment designed to provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge FHIR-enabled healthcare solutions. This cluster will bring together a curated collection of industry-leading applications, and may ultimately include [Bahmni](https://www.bahmni.org/), [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/), and [SMILE CDR](https://www.smiledigitalhealth.com/), to offer learners a comprehensive understanding of real-world healthcare IT systems.


By interacting with these applications within the Galaxy environment, learners can:

* **Explore FHIR Interoperability:** Gain practical insights into how FHIR enables seamless data exchange between different healthcare systems.
* **Experiment with Clinical Workflows:** Simulate real-world clinical scenarios and test various approaches to patient care.
* **Develop Custom Solutions:** Build custom FHIR-based applications and integrations.
* **Collaborate with Peers:** Connect with other learners and share knowledge and experiences.

The Galaxy provides a safe and controlled environment to learn and experiment, empowering the next generation of healthcare IT professionals to drive innovation and improve patient care.
