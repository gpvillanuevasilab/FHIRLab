The FHIRLab FHIR Sandbox for the Philippines envisions a robust, accessible, and collaborative platform that accelerates the adoption and implementation of FHIR standards in the country's healthcare ecosystem. By providing a safe and controlled environment for experimentation, development, and testing, the sandbox empowers healthcare providers, IT professionals, and researchers to innovate and improve patient care.

# Core Components

FHIRLa

## **Clinical Data Repository**

   FHIRLab's CDR is the [HAPI Server](HAPI).
   
   * A centralized repository of standardized health data. 
   * Stores patient records, lab results, medications, and other relevant clinical information.
   * Enables data-driven insights and supports clinical decision-making.

## **Terminology Server**

   FHIRLab's Terminology Server is the [Ontoserver](Ontoserver).

   * Provides a central source of standardized healthcare terminology.
   * Includes code systems, value sets, and concept maps.
   * Ensures consistent data representation and interoperability.   

## **Validator**

   FHIRLab's Validator is the [HL7 Validator](Validator).

   * Verifies the accuracy and completeness of FHIR resources.
   * Checks compliance with FHIR standards and local implementation guidelines.
   * Helps developers identify and correct errors in their FHIR implementations.   

## **Testing Tool**

   FHIRLab's Testing Tool is [Inferno](Inferno).

   * Offers a range of tools for testing FHIR-based applications.
   * Includes test data generators, performance testing tools, and security testing tools.
   * Facilitates the development of robust and secure FHIR solutions.
