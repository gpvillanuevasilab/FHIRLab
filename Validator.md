The documentation for the validator is located at [https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Validator). The user interface has equivalent settings to all command-line options. The main flow of actions is described below.

3. **Choose Validation Options:** Select the appropriate FHIR version and any relevant IGs.
4. **Validate:** Click the "Validate" button to initiate the validation process.
5. **Review Results:** The validator will display the validation results, including any errors or warnings.

# Key Features

* **Resource Validation:** Users can upload FHIR resources in various formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and validate them against the specified FHIR version and IG.
